- Angular modules are meant to be containers that group
all routes/components trees that can be loaded 
independently of each other. That way browser will only
load parts that are needed for that part of the site 
(not all).

- Every component, service, directive, pipe must be 
registered in a Module, to be available there.
They (except serivces) are ONLY available in THAT module.

- Small apps usually have one module, but as it grow 
bigger, it requires more modules.

- Bootstraping of our app begins with "main.ts" file
(loaded by Webpack via "angular.json" file),
which loads an AppModule (the root of the tree) 
-> which then includes AppComponent as the one providing logic.
AppModule is only aware of AppComponent, but it's index.html
that actually displays it.

- next: look at app.module.ts
- We should place all static files in "assets" folder and that's
because in "angular.json" there is "assets[]" and src/assets is 
included in the array -- for images and files
but for CSS styles, there is "styles["src/style.css"]" array.
