<!-- We could bind what someone typed like this: <input (input)="userName=$event.target.value" />
    but the sintax is terrible, so we'll use another way: ngModel

    [] => bind component property to HTML element, commonly used to display data from component on the page
    () => bind HTML element to component method/prop, commonly used for responding to events 
    [()] => TWO-WAY BINDING for editing existing data
    We want to display exitsting data and also bind what someone has typed in to a component property 
    (update it as someone types, so we can send http request with it or smth)
    For a login form, we don't want anything to initialy display, thus we need only one-way binding

    NgModel requires also a name attribute in html
    If we don't have same-named properties in the component, ngModel would bind it to the form.
    We just need to add local variable on the form with #.
    We defined a variable as a wrapper to ngForm and passed form's values to login method.
    It's better to use (ngSubmit) than (submit) bcz it handles few things, like preventing form from submiting to the server.
